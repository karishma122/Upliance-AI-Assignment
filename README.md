- `OrderDetails`

### 2. Cleaning and Standardizing
- Columns are standardized to ensure consistent formatting across datasets.
- Missing values are handled appropriately:

### 3. Merging Datasets
Datasets are merged using common keys (`user_id` and `session_id`) to create a unified dataset that provides a comprehensive view of user behavior, cooking habits, and order details.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Conversion Rate**: Analyzed the percentage of cooking sessions that resulted in orders.
- **Dish Popularity**: Identified the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes.
- **Demographic Factors**:
  - Explored the influence of age and location on order behavior.
  - Analyzed the distribution of orders across different cities and age groups.

### 5. Visualizations
Visualizations were created to highlight key trends and insights:
- **Top 5 Popular Dishes**: Bar chart showing the most frequently ordered dishes.
- **Orders by Age Group**: Bar chart illustrating engagement across age groups.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, key insights were derived, and actionable recommendations were provided to optimize the platformâ€™s offerings and improve user retention.
